                Spatial and kinesthetic cues for recalling data features in Mixed Reality, Virtual Reality, 3D and 2D

                The rich visual cues of the real world can help us encode, process and remember information. Advanced visual technologies,
            such as 3D representations, Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality, approximate this reality. This paper explores how the additional cues
            provided by these technologies, through enhanced depth, presence and locomotion, might improve information recall when consuming
            a corpus of visualizations. Our baseline consists of a 2D page presenting visualizations in a sequential order. We study the effect of
            adding (1) spatial cues– placing visualizations in a 3D room (3D, VR and MR); (2) dynamic depth cues– enabling users to virtually
            change their point of view within a 3D room (VR and MR), and (3) kinesthetic cues associated with locomotion– enabling the user to
            physically move in a room in Mixed Reality (MR). Results of our study show increased recall, and greater richness of data understanding
            in the Mixed Reality condition. Participants recalled more Isotype visualizations, more syntactic details and more semantic patterns.
            We discuss how kinesthetic cues provided by locomotion in MR could contribute to these results. We also discuss why we did not
            observe comparable performance in 3D and Virtual Reality, which has been observed in related contexts (e.g., Data Mountain,
            Memory Palace.)
