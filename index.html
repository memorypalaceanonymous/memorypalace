                The memory palace technique is a mnemonic device originally described by Luria (ref ), which improves the recall of items by linkingthem to a physical location. There are many examples of using this technique to improve the memorization of lists of objects, andpictures of faces and items, but little has been done with data visualization. In this paper we will fill this gap by providing evidence ofthe applicability of this technique to recall, and to remember the semantic meaning, of charts. We study data recall and understanding,comparing 2D, 3D, Virrtual Reality and Mixed Reality data presentation methods. We ask participants to memorize 4 sets of 10 isotypedata visualizations under 4 conditions: a scrollable list of image presented on a computer (2D), images anchored in a 3D environmentpresented on a computer (3D), images anchored in the same 3D environment presented in a Virtual Reality environment (VR), andvirtual images anchored in the same physical space used to create the previous environments (AR). We show that the memory palaceeffect also works with data visualization and that its efficiency varies with the type of data presentation technique. In terms of syntacticrecall, i.e., the ability to remember the graphical objects in the image, the AR condition outperforms. Regarding semantic recall, i.e. theshape of the data, the results are more mitigated (?) while AR still exhibits better performances. Finally, the details recall shows againbetter performances with the AR device. These results are attributed to improved immersion and spatial memory afforded by theAugmented reality environment
