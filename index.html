                Spatial and kinesthetic cues for recalling data features in Mixed Reality, Virtual Reality, 3D and 2D

                Data storytelling often involves presenting a series of visualizations depicting different aspects or facets of a topic, which
                the audience could recall. Research from cognitive psychology has shown that richer visual environments, such as 3-D representations,
                Virtual Reality, and Mixed Reality, can augment memory. This paper explores how the additional cues provided by these technologies,
                through enhanced depth, presence and locomotion, might improve information recall when consuming a corpus of visualizations. Our
                baseline consists of a 2D page presenting visualizations in a sequential order. We study the effect of adding (1) spatial memory cues–
                placing visualizations in a 3D room; (2) dynamic depth cues– enabling the user to virtually change his point of view within a 3D room,
                and (3) kinesthetic cues associated with locomotion– enabling the user to physically move in a room in Mixed Reality. Results of our
                study with 16 participants show increased recall, greater richness of data understanding, and greater confidence, in the Mixed Reality
                condition. Participants recalled more visualizations, more syntactic details and more semantic patterns. We discuss how kinesthetic
                cues provided by locomotion in MR could account for these results. We also discuss why we did not observe enhanced performance in
                3D and Virtual Reality, which has been observed in other, non-data visualization, contexts
